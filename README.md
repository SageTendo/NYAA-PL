# NYAA-PL (Not Yet Another Abstracted Programming Language)  
  
## Introduction  
  
NYAA-PL is an interpreted programming language developed in Python (because why not :P),  
created for fun and exploration in the realms of language and compiler design. Inspired by  
anime, memes and the japanese language (borrowed and native words) references, this isn't  
intended for real-world use.  
  
## Code Examples    
##### Hello_World.ny (single statement body)  
```  
# program block  
uWu_nyaa() => purinto("Hello, world!");  
```  
  
##### Greet.ny  
```  
# function definition  
kawaii greet(name) {  
 purinto("Hello,", name)}  
  
# program block  
uWu_nyaa() => {  
	# Get input from user and assign it to name
	name asain ohayo("Enter name: ") 
	greet(name)
 }  
```
